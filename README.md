# A_star Phase 1

Open and run the .py file
Enter the required parameters
The parameters are: x & y co-ordinates of start and goal points, stating and goal orientation and step size.
The code implements A star algorithm and finds out the optimal path.

# A_star Phase 2

Open the .py file and run it
Enter the required inputs such as start points, orientation, goal and rpm values when prompted. 
The heuristic value is set to 1.5 (line 110 in code, feel free to change it to increase the optimality of the path) and the clearance as 0.2.

PS: We have scaled this map by 100 times
output video and image will be saved in the current directory
